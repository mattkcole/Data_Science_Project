## Introduction

Internet trolls are a considered a menace in nearly all online communities by creating fruitless arguments in an attempt to generate emotional, and typically angry reactions. Motivations behind these people are unclear, but some social scientists have postulated that a strange phenomenon known as the "disinhibition effect" may be to blame. Masked behind the apparent anonymity provided by many forms, sites, and the internet in general, social reservations that facilitate normal, face-to-face conversations are gone, resulting in sometimes wild and rude behavior. Troll behavior can range from simply posting the same status repeatedly to annoy and clog streams of information to violent threats and many, many 'things' in between.

## Data

Trolls were defined as users with tweets which appeared to both:

Data was collected from twitter using both the Twitter API and web app. Initial data collection consisted of both searching twitter for political figures in tweet text (ie. clinton, trump).

In total, around 2000 tweets from 271 individual accounts were assessed and categorized by reading the most recent 10 tweets at time of data collection from each user.

Using data from the last ten tweets (inclusive of retweets), we were able to assess average tweet sentiment using the AFINN lexicon which comprises of English words with valence measures between -5 and 5 inclusive. with an integer between minus five (negative) and plus five (positive). In addition, an emoji dictionary was scrapped from
